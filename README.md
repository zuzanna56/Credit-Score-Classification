# Credit-Score-Classification

## About The Project

This project was created as the final submission for course Introduction to Machine Larning. Created by Zuzanna Piróg and Adrian Zaręba. We were given task to build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score, given a person’s credit-related information.

First we prepared the data during preprocessing and then we tried different models such as e.g. random forest and XGBoost.
You can find the results of our work in the Presentation files that compares the results and different approaches we took.
